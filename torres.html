		<h3> Favorite CMSC subject: </h3>
		<p> My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 21. <br/>
		It was the first time that I learned the <br/>
		programming language C, and I just love how <br/>
		programming with C can do so much stuffs.
		</p>
		<h3> Favorite food: </h3>
		<p> I just love anything made of pasta. <br/>
		I actually don't know why. <br/>
		Also, I really love anything with cheese. <br/>
		I just love how it is somewhat sticky in my mouth. <br/>
		I love how the taste cheese pours in my mouth. <br/>
		I love how it is salty and creamy at the same time. <br/>
		I would be happy to eat cheese all day long. <br/>
		</p>
		<h3> About Me: </h3>
		<p> I will now tell something about myself. <br/> I am Jem Torres, and my mother said that <br/> my name has some kind of meaning <br/> because my birth somehow endangered her life. <br/> She said that the meaning of jem is 'Jesus Executes Miracle'. <br/> I'm proud of my name, even though it is not that <br/> unique. haha. <br/> Also, I am in love with arts. <br/> I just can't help but keep faling in love with arts. <br/> It's like my lifetime partner. <br/> When I'm sad or mad, I write or draw. <br/> I love all form of arts. <br/> I just sometimes stare at trees and just <br/> appreciate how it was lovely and how would it be like <br/> to sketch something so detailed. </p>
		<h3> Expectations for the subject: </h3>
		<p>
			I actually don't know what to expect <br/> from CMSC 2 other than it will talk <br/> about web programming. 
		</p>
		<h3> Expectations for the teacher: </h3>
		<p>
			Uhmm, I expect the teacher to be <br/> approachable and friendly. It would make <br/> the subject a lot less stressful. Also, if possible, a bit considerate and <br/> strict at the same time. :)
